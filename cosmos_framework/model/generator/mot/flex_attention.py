"""FlexAttention implementation of the generation tower's attention.

``two_way_attention`` (see ``attention.py``) computes the generator's attention over
every token of its own sample -- the UND (understanding / caption) tokens and the GEN
tokens together. Its dense path does that in one kernel because "attend to the whole
sample" is plain block-diagonal, which flash can express. The multiview supertoken
rules restrict the GEN->GEN quadrant only, and the resulting combined mask is no
longer block-diagonal, so this module expresses it as a single FlexAttention call over
the concatenated ``[UND | GEN]`` key/value stream.

One fused call rather than two merged ones is deliberate. Splitting the quadrants into
separate kernels and recombining them with ``merge_attentions`` gives an identical
forward, but NATTEN's merge repairs the backward by writing the merged ``(out, lse)``
back into the buffers the attention kernel saved, and the heads-last conversion below
copies those buffers, so the repair silently misses and the GEN branch backpropagates
against its local softmax normalization. Fusing needs no LSE, no merge, and no such
contract; ``flex_attention_test`` checks the fused gradients against a dense reference.

This runs in three explicit phases:

1. :class:`FlexMetadata` holds the per-token fields (packed ``sample_id``, plus the
   multiview supertoken fields ``frame_id`` / ``view_id`` / ``is_noisy`` /
   ``is_control``), covering the ``[UND | GEN]`` key stream;
   :func:`build_multiview_flex_metadata` derives them from a packed batch.
2. :func:`build_block_mask` derives the ``BlockMask`` from that metadata, once per
   forward and outside the decoder layers. The mask is rectangular: GEN tokens are
   the queries, ``[UND | GEN]`` the keys.
3. :func:`flex_attention` runs the attention with that mask.

The ``BlockMask`` is the only artifact the attention path carries. The per-token
fields exist solely to define the ``mask_mod``, so a caller that just wants the mask
for a packed multiview batch should use :func:`build_multiview_block_mask`, which
runs phases 1 and 2 and returns the mask alone.

Which kernels this lowers onto is :func:`resolve_flex_backend`'s answer, taken once per
forward: FlashAttention-4 where it is installed and supported, FlexAttention's Triton
kernels otherwise (``flex_attention.backend`` in the model config pins either). The FA4
mask has to be built at :func:`flash_backend_block_size` and its streams padded to that
coarser query block, so the returned :class:`FlexBackend` carries the block size and the
padding multiple alongside the kernel options rather than leaving the three to be matched
up by hand. ``flex_attention_bench`` times both backends and documents the install.

The supertoken rules :func:`build_block_mask` enforces, all within a sample: RGB
conditioning tokens reach RGB conditioning tokens, RGB noisy tokens reach noisy and
conditioning alike, both within whatever view footprint ``attention_scope`` admits (every
view by default). Control tokens -- a WSM (World Scenario Map) control video, say -- are a
separate modality read off ``is_control``: RGB tokens reach them at their own view only,
control tokens reach each other at their own view only, and no control token reaches an RGB
token at all. Every GEN token, conditioning or noisy, attends to every UND token of its own
sample, as the dense gen->und pass does. See :func:`_multiview_pair_predicate` for the rules
themselves; richer patterns mean more metadata fields and a longer ``mask_mod``, not new
varlen bookkeeping.

LSE convention
--------------
``AuxRequest(lse=True)`` returns the log-sum-exp of the scaled scores in **natural log**, at
the default ``1/sqrt(head_dim)`` scale, in the ``[B, H, S]`` layout -- identical to
``cosmos_framework.model.attention(..., return_lse=True)`` once transposed to heads-last ``[B, S, H]``,
so a caller that does want to merge this output with another attention term can. The fused
path does not ask for it: it is a complete attention, and the gradient the request puts in
the graph is what the FlashAttention-4 backward refuses to lower.

@dataclass
class FlexMetadata:
    """Per-key-token metadata that drives the flex block mask.

    Each field is a 1-D ``[seq_len]`` tensor covering the key/value stream the mask
    spans, in packed token order. All are ``int64`` except ``is_noisy`` and ``is_control``,
    which are ``bool``. Padding positions carry the sentinel ``-1`` (``False`` for the two
    bool fields) so real queries never attend to padding and padded queries attend only to
    padding (no empty-softmax NaN).

    The key stream is the concatenation ``[UND | GEN]``: ``num_und`` block-padded
    understanding tokens followed by the block-padded GEN tokens. The GEN tokens are
    also the queries, so the mask this drives is rectangular -- ``q_len`` rows,
    ``seq_len`` columns -- and query index ``i`` is key index ``i + num_und``. Leaving
    ``num_und`` at 0 describes a GEN-only stream and yields the square GEN self-attention
    mask, which is what the metadata unit tests exercise.

    All tensor fields are required. They describe the multiview supertoken layout and
    drive the ``mask_mod`` in :func:`build_block_mask`:

    * ``sample_id``: packed sample index per token; yields the block-diagonal
      same-sample constraint every rule requires. UND tokens carry the sample they
      belong to, which is the only field their rule reads.
    * ``frame_id`` / ``view_id``: per-token frame and view indices; ``-1`` on UND
      tokens, which have no place in the camera grid.
    * ``is_noisy``: ``bool`` tensor, ``True`` for noisy (visual) tokens and
      ``False`` for conditioning tokens (and for UND tokens).
    * ``is_control``: ``bool`` tensor, ``True`` for tokens of a control item (e.g. a WSM --
      World Scenario Map -- control video), ``False`` for every other token (RGB and UND
      alike). It carries no per-item identity, so control tokens sharing a view read as one
      signal; since the control rules only ever pair within a view, that costs nothing as
      long as a view holds a single control stream, which is the caller's to arrange (see
      ``MaskItem.is_control``). The field is also the only switch the control rules have: the
      ordinary T2V/I2V/V2V batch marks no control item, carries it all-``False``, and the
      control terms drop out of the predicate on their own -- one fewer place for a config flag
      and the data it describes to disagree.

    The mask enforces, within a sample:

    * GEN Q -> UND K: always (the gen->und pass, unrestricted);
    * RGB conditioning Q -> RGB conditioning K: within whatever ``AttentionScope`` admits
      (every view, its own view, or its own view or frame);
    * RGB conditioning Q -> RGB noisy K: never;
    * RGB noisy Q -> RGB noisy or conditioning K alike: within the same
      ``AttentionScope`` reach;
    * RGB Q (conditioning or noisy) -> control K: same view, any frame;
    * control Q -> control K: same view, any frame;
    * control Q -> RGB K: never.

    :func:`_multiview_pair_predicate` is where those rules are actually expressed, so it is
    the one to trust if this list and it ever drift apart.

    ``attention_scope`` is a choice rather than a description of the batch; it rides here
    so that the two places the predicate is built from -- the ``mask_mod`` the kernel
    calls and the block-level collapsing in :func:`build_block_mask` -- cannot be given
    different answers: a block the collapsing calls fully unmasked is one the kernel never
    calls ``mask_mod`` on at all, so the two disagreeing would not raise, it would silently
    attend across views.

    This type is an intermediate: :func:`build_block_mask` folds it into a
    :class:`BlockMask` and only that mask travels on to
    :func:`flex_attention`. The tensors themselves stay reachable through the
    mask's ``mask_mod`` closure, which the kernel evaluates on partially-masked
    blocks, so nothing here can be freed early.

    Passing the key-stream fields on both sides gives the predicate over **key-stream
    coordinates**, which is what the block-level collapsing in :func:`build_block_mask`
    needs: it evaluates the predicate on group representatives, and those are key-stream
    positions on both sides. Passing the query fields on the left instead gives the
    ``mask_mod`` FlexAttention itself calls -- see :func:`_multiview_mask_mod`.

    All rules are gated on ``same_sample`` (block-diagonal packing). On top of
    that, using the per-token frame/view/modality metadata:

    * any GEN Q attends to every UND K of its sample -- the gen->und pass, which
      carries no further restriction;
    * RGB conditioning Q attends only to RGB conditioning K, within whatever
      ``attention_scope`` admits (every view, its own view, or its own view or frame);
    * RGB conditioning Q -> RGB noisy K: never (no rule fires for this quadrant);
    * RGB noisy Q attends every RGB K -- noisy or conditioning alike -- within the same
      ``attention_scope`` reach;
    * RGB Q (conditioning or noisy alike) attends every control K of its **own view**, any
      frame;
    * control Q attends every control K of its **own view**, any frame, and no RGB K at all.

    Every rule here is a view rule, not a ``(frame, view)`` one. Every scope gives a query
    its own view at *any* frame, which is what makes ``"same_view"`` a clip's own attention
    rather than a set of stills, and a token's frame matters only through
    ``"same_view_or_frame"``, which adds every other view at the query's own instant and so
    registers the cameras against each other. Frames are free at the block level anyway,
    because :func:`_metadata_groups` already splits its runs per ``(item, frame, view)``
    cell, so the coarse predicate tells views and frames apart without a finer grouping.

    A batch with no control item carries ``is_control`` all-``False``, which drops both
    control terms on its own -- see :class:`FlexMetadata`.

    Neither control rule can fire on a UND key: both require ``k_control``, which UND tokens
    carry as ``False``. The RGB rules are less tidy. Under ``"all_views"``,
    ``reaches_every_view`` alone satisfies ``rgb_pair_in_scope`` for a UND key, so a GEN
    query admits its own sample's UND keys through that term too; nothing observable changes,
    since ``gen_to_und`` already admits them unconditionally, but the UND quadrant is not
    exclusively ``gen_to_und``'s doing under that scope. Under the other two scopes the RGB
    rules compare ``view_id`` / ``frame_id``, where UND's ``-1`` matches no real GEN token.

    Padding carries ``-1`` in every id field, so real queries never see it and padded queries
    attend only to padding. The packer keeps at least one padded row on each stream once
    either is padded, so a padded query always has a padded key to attend to.

    ``items_per_sample`` is one list of :class:`MaskItem` per packed sample, in packed
    order, describing every generation stream the sample carries: its camera clips, its
    LiDAR range clips, and whichever of those are control streams. The nesting is the
    grouping, so nothing here has to check that a flat item list and a per-sample count
    agree -- and :class:`MaskItem` has already checked each item on its own terms.

    What is left to check is the one invariant that spans items: those of a sample
    **sharing a view offset** have to agree on their ``(num_views, frames_per_view)``
    grid, since that is the coordinate system the mask compares views and frames in. Items
    on disjoint offsets are paired by no rule and are free to differ -- a joint camera +
    LiDAR sample carries a 71-latent camera pair on view 0 beside a 94-sweep range pair on
    view 1. See :func:`_check_view_grids_agree`.

    Args:
        seq_len: block-padded GEN sequence length, i.e. the query count. The returned
            fields are ``[num_und + seq_len]``, covering the fused ``[UND | GEN]`` key
            stream.
        full_q_offsets: cumulative per-sample GEN offsets, ``[len(items_per_sample) + 1]``;
            ``full_q_offsets[-1]`` is the real (unpadded) GEN token count, which the items'
            own token counts have to add up to.
        items_per_sample: the items each sample owns, in packed order. See
            :class:`MaskItem` for what one describes and which of its fields the mask
            rules read.
        device: device for the returned tensors.
        num_und: block-padded UND (causal) stream length, which prefixes the key
            stream. 0 leaves the metadata GEN-only, for a square self-attention mask.
        causal_offsets: cumulative per-sample UND offsets, ``[num_samples + 1]``;
            required when ``num_und`` is non-zero, since the UND rule is "same sample"
            and nothing else. ``causal_offsets[-1]`` is the real UND token count, so
            everything past it is padding.
        attention_scope: which same-kind (RGB) tokens of its sample a token reaches --
            those of every view, of its own view, or of its own view or frame. See
            ``AttentionScope``; :class:`FlexMetadata` carries it on to both forms of the
            predicate. Never widens a control token's reach, which is always its own view.
            ``"same_view_or_frame"`` is rejected once more than one view offset is in play,
            because that scope pairs across views by frame index and a second sensor does
            not share the camera's frame index -- 7.5 Hz camera latents against 10 Hz
            sweeps.

    Returns:
        :class:`FlexMetadata` whose five per-token fields are each
        ``[num_und + seq_len]``: the UND tokens (sample ids only, ``-1`` / ``False`` in
        every multiview field), then the real GEN tokens in packed order, each stream
        followed by ``-1`` sentinels (``False`` for ``is_noisy`` and ``is_control``)
        across its trailing pad.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the items of one sample sharing a view offset disagree on the
            ``(num_views, frames_per_view)`` grid, if the items' token counts do not add up

    """Build the GEN-tower :class:`BlockMask` from precomputed flex metadata.

    Uses the multiview supertoken ``mask_mod``; the multiview fields
    (``frame_id`` / ``view_id`` / ``is_noisy`` / ``is_control``) must be populated on
    ``metadata``.

    ``create_block_mask`` is deliberately not used here. It evaluates the predicate
    into a dense ``[Q_LEN, KV_LEN]`` bool tensor before reducing it to blocks, and
    Inductor does not fuse that intermediate away for this ``mask_mod``, so the build
    costs one byte per token pair: 24 GiB at 162k tokens and 98 GiB at 324k, which is
    where 11 cameras at 720p land.

    Instead the predicate is collapsed onto the ``G`` runs of equal metadata
    (:func:`_metadata_groups`), which for a multiview pack is one run per
    ``(item, frame, view)`` cell -- a few hundred, against hundreds of thousands of
    tokens. ``allowed [G, G]`` is the predicate at that granularity, ``presence
    [num_blocks, G]`` marks which runs each block of tokens touches, and the two
    matmuls below count, for every block pair, the allowed and the blocked run pairs
    it spans. A block pair is fully unmasked when it spans no blocked pair and
    partially masked when it spans at least one of each. Both matmuls accumulate
    non-negative terms and are only ever compared against zero, so the counts do not
    have to be exactly representable for the comparisons to be exact.

    That makes the build ``O(num_q_blocks * num_kv_blocks * G)`` in time and
    ``O(num_q_blocks * num_kv_blocks)`` in memory, versus ``O(seq_len**2)`` for both
    before.

    Call this from outside the decoder layers and hand the returned mask to the
    attention path: the group count is data-dependent, so materializing it syncs with
    the host, which Dynamo cannot trace inside a compiled, activation-checkpointed
    layer. Building it once per forward also avoids rebuilding the identical mask in
    every layer.

            The whole object rather than those options alone, because the two only mean
            anything together -- FlashAttention-4's options are correct for a mask built at
            that backend's block size and silently wrong for any other -- so passing it lets
