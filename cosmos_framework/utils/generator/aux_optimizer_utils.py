"""Shared parameter-categorization for the orthogonalizing optimizers (Muon / Dion2).

Both ``MuonWithAuxAdamW`` and ``Dion2WithAuxAdamW`` only apply their
orthogonalized (Newton-Schulz) update to *hidden* ``nn.Linear`` weight matrices.
Everything else -- token / positional embeddings, the output head (``lm_head``),
layer-norm scales, biases, and any non-Linear parameter -- must use the auxiliary
AdamW.

The tricky part is reliably identifying the **embeddings** and the **output head**
across every model architecture in the repo (Qwen3, GPT-OSS, DeepSeekV3, Gemma4,
Qwen3-VL-MoE, unified MoT, ...). We do not rely on a single hard-coded name.
Instead :func:`split_orthogonalizable_params` combines four signals:

1. **Module type** -- ``nn.Embedding`` weights always go to AdamW (and they are
   never ``nn.Linear`` so they would never reach Muon anyway).
2. **Name keywords** -- a configurable set of substrings (default ``{"lm_head"}``,
   the convention used by every LLM in this repo) marks output-head Linears.
3. **Tied weights** -- a Linear whose ``weight`` tensor is *the same object* as an
   ``nn.Embedding`` weight (``tie_word_embeddings=True``) is the tied output head.
4. **Vocabulary shape** -- a Linear whose output dimension equals some
   ``nn.Embedding.num_embeddings`` (the vocab size) is treated as an output
   projection.

Signals (2)-(4) are OR-ed, so an output head is excluded from Muon/Dion2 even if a
new architecture names it differently or ties it to the embedding. The failure
mode of the heuristics is conservative: a misclassified weight falls back to
AdamW (always safe) rather than being orthogonalized.

    """Split ``model``'s trainable params by whether they can be orthogonalized.

    Args:
        model: The (sub)module to walk -- typically the trainable ``net``.
        optimizer_param_ids: ``id()`` of every parameter actually owned by the
            optimizer's param groups. Only these are categorized, so that
            ``keys_to_select`` filtering is respected and ``state_dict`` stays
            consistent.
        expert_param_keywords: Name substrings that mark **stacked MoE expert**
            parameters -- raw ``nn.Parameter`` tensors of shape ``[num_experts, M,
            N]`` (e.g. ``gate_up_proj`` / ``down_proj``). When a 3-D+ param matches,
            it is routed to the orthogonalizable side so the optimizer can treat
            each expert slice as its own matrix. Empty (default) keeps expert
            params on AdamW, i.e. no behavior change.

            NOTE (sharding assumption): the optimizer orthogonalizes these per
            expert slice assuming the tensor is sharded on dim 0 (the expert axis),
            which holds for the FSDP2 ``fully_shard`` path used here (FSDP2 shards
            every parameter on dim 0) and makes the update communication-free. It is
            NOT guaranteed if tensor/expert parallelism shards *within* an expert
            matrix (dim 1/2); that case is unsupported and rejected at step time by
            ``MuonWithAuxAdamW._step_stacked_muon`` / ``Dion2WithAuxAdamW._step_stacked_dion2``.
            This was not exhaustively audited across every parallelization config,
            hence the runtime guard there.

            TODO(expert-parallelism): support 2-D sharding of stacked expert params.
            With expert parallelism, dim 0 would be sharded along the expert axis and
            dim 1 along the FSDP axis simultaneously, so each rank holds a shard of a
            *slice* of each expert matrix rather than whole expert matrices. The
            per-expert-slice orthogonalization here assumes dim-0-only sharding (whole
            expert matrices are local), so it would need to reconstruct each expert
            matrix across the FSDP axis (an all-gather along dim 1, like the dense
            2-D path) before running Newton-Schulz. Doable, but needs changes.
        orthogonalize_skip_patterns: Extra regex patterns matched (``re.search``)
            against each 2-D ``nn.Linear`` weight's parameter name. Concatenated with
            the built-in ``DEFAULT_ORTHOGONALIZE_SKIP_PATTERNS`` (output heads) into a
            single check: any match forces that weight onto the auxiliary AdamW side
            (skips orthogonalization). The embedding-by-type / tied-weight (``id()``
            dedup) / stacked-expert rules are separate and still apply. This is the
            general, name-based way to keep specific Linear weights off Muon/Dion2 --
            e.g.
            ``r"\\.gate\\.weight$"`` for MoE router/gate weights (matches
            ``...mlp.gate.weight`` / ``...mlp_moe_gen.gate.weight`` but not
            ``gate_proj`` / ``gate_noise``). Empty (default) skips nothing extra
            (no behavior change).

    Returns:
        ``(orthogonalizable, unorthogonalizable, param_to_name)`` where
        ``orthogonalizable`` holds the hidden ``nn.Linear`` weights (2-D) and, when
        ``expert_param_keywords`` is set, the stacked expert tensors (3-D); the
        optimizer splits those by rank. ``unorthogonalizable`` is everything else
        (embeddings, output head, biases, norms, other non-Linear params), which
        uses the auxiliary AdamW.

    renormalizes whatever it is handed to unit spectral norm, so an inactive
