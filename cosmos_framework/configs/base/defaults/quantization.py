    parameters are selected for quantization via include/exclude key filters.
    When ``method`` is None, quantization is disabled and all other fields are
    inert.

    ``mxfp8`` and ``nvfp4`` use block-scaled MX / NVFP4 formats that require
    Blackwell (sm_100) tensor cores. ``fp8`` is plain e4m3 dynamic-activation +
    fp8-weight quantization that also runs on Hopper (sm_90) and Ada (sm_89).
