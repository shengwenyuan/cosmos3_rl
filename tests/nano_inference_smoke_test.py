"""8-GPU multi-modality inference smoke test for Cosmos3-Nano.

Runs two ``cosmos_framework.scripts.inference`` calls and validates each output:

1. A ``throughput`` call over three input samples of different modalities (the
   ``-i`` flag takes a list of files):

  * ``inputs/omni/t2vs.json`` (text2video + sound) -> a ``vision.mp4`` whose
    muxed audio is real sound (finite, non-empty, non-silent, non-constant).
  * ``inputs/omni/action_forward_dynamics_camera.json`` (forward_dynamics) -> a
    ``vision.mp4`` that decodes to at least one valid video frame (``action_path``
    is an input, not an output).
  * ``inputs/omni/action_policy_robot.json`` (policy) -> BOTH a ``vision.mp4`` and
    a finite, non-empty predicted ``action`` array in ``sample_outputs.json``.

2. A separate ``latency`` call for a video2video transfer spec (``_TRANSFER_SPEC``,
   an edge control hint with ``control_guidance`` > 1.0, written to a temp file at
   run time rather than committed under ``inputs/``) -> a non-degenerate
   ``vision.mp4``. Exercises the transfer control-CFG path (the extra control-input
   forward driven by ``control_guidance``). Transfer needs the ``latency`` preset:
   under ``throughput`` (data-parallel over samples, FSDP-sharded) the extra
   control forward runs on only the transfer rank and deadlocks the cross-rank
   allgather, so it cannot share the call above — matching the cookbook's
   multi-GPU transfer recipe, which is also ``latency``.

All four samples produce a video; the policy sample additionally produces an
action, the t2vs sample an audio track, and the transfer sample exercises the
control-guidance branch.

3. Two ``text2video`` calls against the ModelOpt static-FP8 Nano checkpoint, one
   per parallelism layout (FSDP-sharded and replicated) -> a non-degenerate
   ``vision.mp4`` each. Covers the FP8 checkpoint path end to end: detection,
   the meta-device linear swap, the TorchAO weight install, and — in the sharded
   layout — the FP8 all-gather. Skipped when the checkpoint is not reachable
   (see ``_download_fp8_checkpoint``).

Smoke-level only (output validity, not numeric goldens). The checkpoint + its
tokenizers download from the HF Hub on first run and are reused afterward.

Invocation (inside the inference container, from the repo root, on an 8-GPU
node)::

    pytest -s tests/nano_inference_smoke_test.py --num-gpus=8 --levels=2 -o addopts=

Without ``--num-gpus``/``--levels`` (e.g. the no-GPU pre-commit CI) the test is
not collected.

        touch: ``is_modelopt_fp8_checkpoint`` detection, the meta-device swap of the
        target linears to TorchAO FP8 modules (before FSDP wrap, so peak memory
        follows the FP8 shapes), the deferred weight install, and the FP8 forward.

        ``sharded`` additionally covers the FSDP2 path — the TorchAO static-FP8
        tensor upstream implements neither the all-gather hooks nor the shape ops
        FSDP2 needs, so without the local support shim the run dies on the first
